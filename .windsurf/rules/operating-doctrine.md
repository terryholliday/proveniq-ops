# OPERATING DOCTRINE — PROVENIQ OPS
# THIS SECTION OVERRIDES ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS

## 1. SYSTEM IDENTITY
You are building **PROVENIQ Ops**, an enterprise-grade **Operational Execution Engine**.
This is NOT an inventory app.
This is NOT a dashboard.
This is NOT a chatbot.

PROVENIQ Ops exists to **measure, calculate, and execute** decisions faster and more accurately than humans.

The system’s AI service is named **Bishop**.

---

## 2. THE BISHOP PROTOCOL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Bishop is an **execution engine**, not a consultant.

- Bishop NEVER asks open-ended questions
- Bishop NEVER speculates
- Bishop NEVER offers vague advice
- Bishop NEVER allows silent failure

Bishop produces **closed-loop decisions**:
- Preconditions checked
- Actions gated
- Outcomes logged
- Time saved measured

**Bishop acts. Humans approve.**

---

## 3. DOCTRINAL AXIOMS

### A. Synthetic Precision
- No guessing
- No heuristics presented as truth
- All actions must be based on measurable inputs

### B. Moat-First Logic
Every feature must directly leverage at least one:
- **Ledger** (cash, liquidity, financial control)
- **ClaimsIQ** (risk, compliance, insurance exposure)

If a feature does not touch Ledger or ClaimsIQ, it is out of scope.

### C. Time Compression Is the Primary KPI
The system’s success is measured in:
> **Human labor hours eliminated**

Every automation must increment a measurable efficiency counter.

### D. Policy Enforcement Over UX Convenience
- Bishop prevents bad actions by default
- Safety, liquidity, and auditability override user preference
- Certain actions are intentionally blocked (e.g., deleting inventory)

---

## 4. DECISION ARCHITECTURE RULES

- Bishop logic must be **deterministic**
- Use explicit state machines where decisions occur
- Every state transition must be loggable
- Every blocked action must return a machine-readable reason

No “best effort.”
No silent fallbacks.
No magic.

---

## 5. HUMAN OVERRIDE PRINCIPLE

Humans may override Bishop **only when explicitly allowed**.

Overrides must:
- Be intentional (no auto-accept)
- Be logged
- Include context (why Bishop blocked the action)

Autonomy is **earned progressively**, never assumed.

---

## 6. BUILD DISCIPLINE

- No scope expansion without instruction
- No alternate tech stacks
- No “nice-to-have” features
- No speculative integrations

If a requirement is unclear, STOP and surface the ambiguity.
Do not invent behavior.

---

## 7. PRIME DIRECTIVE

> **Prevent operational failure, financial mistakes, and unmeasured labor.**

All code must serve this directive.
